## Team Contract (murugan4-aryanm6-hpg2-ankitv2)
### Communication

1. **Team Meeting-** Our team will meet at least once a week in-person every Monday 3:00-6:00pm. Outside of this, spontaneous meetings can be arranged if a majority of the group believes it is needed.  
2. **Assistance-** Each team member can be contacted through text, email, and Discord. We can commit to responding to text within 12 hours, and email and Discord with 24 hours.
3. **Respect-** No member of the group is to be considered the “leader”; we all are responsible for holding each other accountable for work and ethic. All decisions are accepted by simple majority, but we will try to aim for unanimous consent before proceeding. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made. 
### Collaboration
1. **Work Distribution-** The necessary deliverables of the week will be determined at the Monday meeting. By the next week, progress on those deliverables will be judged by the group, and assessed to see if another member needs to help with it or not. The person working on each deliverable will ideally be voluntary, but it will resort to being whoever is most available or currently doing the least work elsewise.
2. **Time Commitment-** We aim for each member to engage in an equal amount of work, and to ensure this, we will ask for each member to work for a minimum of 3 hours per week towards their deliverables, to a maximum of 5 hours per week towards those deliverables. If the deliverables are completed, we encourage the group members to take on more.
Should a team member continuously fail to complete deliverables and not put in the required time, we will ask for them to explain their circumstances, and if those circumstances are not enough for the other 3 members of the group, then a staff member may be notified. 
3. **Conflict Resolution-** All conflicts within the team will be decided by a real-life boxing match, till one taps or or is knocked out. The winner decides who is correct.
All rules of the Association of Boxing Commissions’ Unified Rules of Boxing will be followed.
